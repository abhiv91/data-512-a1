#Goal
This project graphs the page views of wikipedia from desktop and mobile sources.

Please note that there are significant dips because Wikipedia stated discriminating against crawlers when reporting usage stats. 
More info about the api and the data can be found here:

Legacy API (https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/AQS/Legacy_Pagecounts#Monthly_counts)
Current API (https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/AQS/Pageviews)

Refer to the Wikimedia Terms of use to see what you can and cannot do with this data :
https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use/en

In the CSV file you will fine a timestamp row along with the mobile, desktop and cumulative views for that month from the API that records that time period (There is a period of overlap).
